            <p>
              At Anveshak, we believe in simplicity and transparency. We offer a straightforward monthly subscription 
              at just Rs. 99, giving you full access to all our premium features for 30 days from the date of purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our commitment-free model means you pay only when you need the service, with no auto-renewals or 
              hidden charges. Each subscription is a one-time payment that expires after 30 days, giving you complete 
              control over your spending.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-gray-700">3. No-Refund Policy Benefits</h2>
            <p>
              Our no-refund policy allows us to keep our prices incredibly low at just Rs. 99 per month. By eliminating 
              the administrative costs associated with processing refunds, we can focus our resources on improving the 
              platform and providing you with the best possible service.

              engaged community of users who are committed to using the platform effectively.
