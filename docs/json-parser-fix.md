# JSON Parser Enhancement Fix

## Summary of Changes

We've successfully fixed the JSON parsing issues in the Anveshak  application's email generation functionality. The primary issues were related to handling malformed or incomplete JSON responses from the language model.

## Implemented Changes

1. **Enhanced JSON Validation**:

   - Added more comprehensive validation for JSON structure
   - Added check for balanced braces
   - Added additional JSON repair functionality

2. **Improved JSON Repair**:

   - Created a more robust JSON repair function that handles:
     - Unquoted property names
     - Trailing commas
     - Improperly quoted values
     - Escape sequence issues

3. **Multi-layer Fallback Strategy**:

   - Added multiple parsing fallback methods:
     1. First attempt: Standard JSON parsing after cleaning
     2. Second attempt: Extract clean JSON object from start/end braces
     3. Third attempt: Regex-based extraction for subject and body
     4. Final fallback: Pattern matching from email structure

4. **Applied Same Fixes to Retry Mechanism**:

   - Updated the retry mechanism to use the same enhanced parsing methods
   - Added better debugging for retry attempts

5. **Created Test Suite**:
   - Added `testJsonParsing.js` to verify the robustness of our parsing methods
   - Added test cases for various problematic JSON formats
   - Updated `runAllTests.js` to include the new tests

## Test Results

The JSON parsing tests pass successfully across multiple scenarios:

- Well-formed JSON: ✅ PASS
- Missing closing quotes: ✅ PASS
- Unquoted property names: ✅ PASS
- Incomplete JSON: ✅ PASS
- JSON with control characters: ✅ PASS
- JSON mixed with text: ✅ PASS
- JSON with nested quotes: ✅ PASS

## Known Issues

During testing, we identified an unrelated issue with the Google Generative AI model initialization in the test environment. This shows up as:

```
Error generating research email: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getGenerativeModel')
```

This appears to be an API configuration issue rather than a code problem and is outside the scope of our current JSON parsing fix.

## Conclusion

The implemented changes have successfully resolved the JSON parsing issues in the email generation functionality. The application can now gracefully handle various types of malformed JSON responses from the language model, improving overall reliability and reducing errors related to JSON parsing.
