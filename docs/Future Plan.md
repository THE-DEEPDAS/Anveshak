I want to add a button where user could select that and he will get extra findings from academic institutions like if the option is selected then iits, nits, iits, isro, drdo, iist, iisers and niser will be searched for faculties and will find the faculty with allied interest, then we will mail them a custom resume based on their interests and all written on the website of the institute or their personal portfolio and create a very strong email for getting an internship and getting selected and this all should be done by calling the LLM

We can add different types of resume parsing and make the algo for that more accurate

We can purchase better AI model and implement the better features like pdf parsing and deep research
